# Alloy Signature Checker

This project and worksheet is part of the lecture Formal Methods for Software Engineering. We are using the light-weight formal methods tool Alloy Analyzer.

Usually we use formal methods to analyze software designs by translating analysis problems to formal methods tools. Now we will treat the quality of formal methods specifications as a software analysis problem. In this task we will implement a tool that analyzes properties of Alloy models (using Alloy itself).
